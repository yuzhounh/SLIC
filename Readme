SLIC: a whole brain parcellation toolbox
Copyright (C) 2016 Jing Wang

The SLIC toolbox contains five whole brain parcellation approaches that 
operates on resting-state fMRI data. Three of them are reproduced from the 
Ncut-based approaches in (Craddock et al., 2012, HBM) and (Shen et al., 
2013, Neuroimage). The remaining two are the mean SLIC and two-level SLIC 
approaches, which combine Ncut and SLIC to perform whole brain 
parcellation. By running this demo, you could reproduce the major results 
in our paper. See the Readme_plus file for further information. This 
project is also shared on NITRC, https://www.nitrc.org/projects/slic/. 

Usage:
1. Download the preprocessed fMRI data from NITRC, and then uncompress
the data.
